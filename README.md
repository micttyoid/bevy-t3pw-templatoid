# Note on the external tileset(tsx) used in a map file(tmx)

The current work around:
- Use external tileset
- Embed exactly the same tileset (but don't use it)

Why is this necessary even if embedding a tileset effectively the same as using
the embedded tileset
- Versatility/just-work for your non-technical teammate

# TODO

- Document better
- Bring good stuff back from the mainstream: comments
